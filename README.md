Student Progress Tracker System – README

Overview
--------
The Student Progress Tracker System is a simple Python-based mini project designed for beginners. 
It helps in understanding core Python concepts by building a real-life application that collects 
student details, calculates marks, and generates a progress report.

This project is ideal for B.Tech / Diploma students who are learning Python fundamentals.

Purpose of the Project
----------------------
The main goal of this project is to:
- Practice basic Python programming concepts
- Learn how to take user input and process data
- Understand conditions, loops, and functions
- Generate a clean and readable output report
